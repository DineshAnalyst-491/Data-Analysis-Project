# SQL Data Analysis Project (MySQL Workbench)

## üìä Overview

This project demonstrates advanced **SQL query techniques** and **data analysis** using MySQL Workbench. It explores complex SQL operations such as joins, subqueries, and ranking functions on a music store dataset (similar to Chinook).

The project includes both the SQL model files (`.mwb`) and a presentation (`.pptx`) summarizing query logic and results.

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Basic `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` statements
* `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses for aggregation
* `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL OUTER` joins
* Multi-row and single-row subqueries (`IN`, `NOT IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`)
* Correlated subqueries for dependent relationships
* Window functions: `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `NTILE`, `LEAD`, `LAG`, `PERCENT_RANK`, and `CUME_DIST`

## üìÅ Project Structure

* `database/` ‚Äì Contains MySQL Workbench `.mwb` files for database schema and queries
* `presentation/` ‚Äì PowerPoint explaining query logic and outcomes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

* **MySQL Workbench**
* **SQL (DQL, DML)**
* **Microsoft PowerPoint**

## üßæ How to Use

1. Open the `.mwb` files in **MySQL Workbench**.
2. Review or execute queries on the provided dataset.
3. Refer to the PowerPoint presentation for explanation of each query and result.

## üèÜ Learning Highlights

* Real-world SQL use cases
* Analytical insights using advanced SQL functions
* Professional documentation and presentation of results
